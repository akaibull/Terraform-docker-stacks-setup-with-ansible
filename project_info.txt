- Final Project (3 days).
	 ***This will be done on your own without any external help***. you are free to build your own docker images or use ready made ones. 

    	-Create a docker swarm cluster of 5 services

        - Nginx, Two app servers (either Python flask or nodejs based api), Postgresql database, pgbouncer. 		
	Remember that flask/nodejs will connect to database through pgbouncer
        
	- Figure out the right configuration for each
   
	 - Each Docker swarm image will have an application that is managed by 
	[supervisord](https://	docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/)

        - For app server, you will use the **SAME** source code for both "testing" and "production", but they will work differently based on some environment variable
        
	- To achieve this, you will have two different supervisord configs - one for testing and one for production.
 	   - Logging will be done using Logspout to Logdna
 	
 	  - nginx will be running in host mode on port 80
 	
	   - app images (python or nodejs) will be scaled to two
           - You will do this through 3 docker swarm stacks - nginx will be one stack, python/nodejs will be another stack and postgresql+pgbouncer will be third stack
           - they will communicate with each other using overlay network
    
           - Show how you will redeploy nginx and python/nodejs if you have to make any changes to the config/code (thereby rebuilding the docker image)

	        - try rolling deploys
		    - Deploy this whole system on a Terraform based cloud stack of two instances. You are free to use Cloud Build and Container Registry tools if you want.
